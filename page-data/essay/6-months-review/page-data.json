My journey to the first ever PR merge was not an easy one. Firstly, setting up the Dev Environment to start programming met with many obstacles as my work started remotely. Even though I had experience working remotely as Marketer in my previous job, working remotely as Developer was whole new thing. I had to get past the mental barrier of repeatedly asking for help over Slack to my colleagues whom I barely just met.

Singapore entered a complete lockdown in beginning April where people could not interact with others from different household. Only time people could be out was for purchasing essential groceries or exercising. This continued till end June with measures easing little by little.</p>\n<p>While it may have been a setback for many, I adapted relatively well to the new WFH routines. I was already living a routine life while self-studying to become a Developer so I focused on maintaining good habits for mental health and physical health during lockdown.</p>\n<p>My typical work day during lockdown was:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"markdown\"><pre class=\"language-markdown\"><code class=\"language-markdown\">9AM: Wake up, Make coffee ‚òï &amp; Meditate üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n9.30AM - 6/7PM: Work (From Home) üë®‚Äçüíª\n\n7PM: Run 5km üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è or Home Training üí™\n\n9PM - Sleep: Side Project or additional learning üìö</code></pre></div>\n<p><em>(Of course weekends were spent eating good food and drinking with housemates watching our favourite shows ‚ò∫Ô∏è)</em></p>\n<p>WFH actually gave me a lot of time for self-improvement, be it work or life. These new habits - Mediating and Exercising got me through difficult times like this where things are out of your control. Only thing I could control was how I perceived the situation and I learnt to do this through these new habits. As a Software Dev, I could commit time saved from commuting to working and learning. Building side project and taking additional Udemy courses would have been more difficult if I was travelling to work everyday.</p>\n<div style=\"width:80%;margin:auto;padding-bottom:50%;height:0;position:relative;\">\n<iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/H7kfFDvD9HSYGRbvid\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\"></iframe></div>\n<p style=\"font-size:0.75rem;text-align:center;\"><i>keep calm and meditate</i></p>\n<p>Nobody knows how world will turn out post Covid-19 but these new habits - meditating, exercising and learning are here to stay in my life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"-dislike---can-do-better\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#-dislike---can-do-better\" aria-label=\" dislike   can do better permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>üëé Dislike - Can do better</h2>\n<h3 id=\"lack-of-communications--interaction\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#lack-of-communications--interaction\" aria-label=\"lack of communications  interaction permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Lack of Communications &#x26; Interaction</h3>\n<p>One of the area I need improvement on is involvement in Dev community.</p>\n<p>Since I started working as Software Developer, my expectation was to be actively involved in Dev community with fellow Developers in and out of my workplace to talk about what they build and how they build.

Meeting the people I‚Äôve never met before on the screen was not very comfortable so I gradually interacted less. </p>\n<p>Ironically there were even more online Dev events available as events in other countries were held online but I couldn‚Äôt get out of my comfort zone and missed out on opportunities to meet fellow Developers and learn more from them.</p>\n<p>As I believe that being involved and contributing to the open community is one of the most important aspect of being a Software Dev, I do wish to get better on this - even if Covid-19 hangs around.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sapjil-ÏÇΩÏßà\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#sapjil-%EC%82%BD%EC%A7%88\" aria-label=\"sapjil ÏÇΩÏßà permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Sapjil (ÏÇΩÏßà)</h2>\n<p>Sapjil is a Korean word for digging. I realised that it‚Äôs a very relatable word to be used in software development - describing a Dev getting stuck on a bug or code problem and stubbornly struggling to get past the problem.</p>\n<div style=\"width:80%;margin:auto;padding-bottom:50%;height:0;position:relative;\">\n<iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/4EF5LwiRfpBKQUOsoF\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p style=\"font-size:0.75rem;text-align:center;\"><i>dig and dig..</i></p>\n<p>When I got assigned to a task at work, I would nose-dive into the task without much plan not realising how deep the water was.. Eventually I would end up spending days stuck on a seemingly small and simple issue. Looking back, what I had to do was to test the water - check how deep it is, see if there is any dangerous reef hidden, estimate how long to dive (figuratively) - all such that I could swim back alive to the ship üö¢ on time &#x26; ride with the planned sprint timeline.</p>\n<p>One of the common mistakes was not breaking the dev task into smaller parts. For example, building a UI screen which shows a table with filter panel &#x26; details panel. I tackled this task in non-sequential order taking too much time. By right, I should have tackled them logically by each components.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, if I had <em>Sapjil</em> enough and can‚Äôt seem to find the answer, I need to ask for help from fellow Devs. It will provide new perspective to solve the problem and shorten the development time significantly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"next--coming-soon\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#next--coming-soon\" aria-label=\"next  coming soon permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Next &#x26; Coming soon,,,</h2>\n<p>So I‚Äôve shared what I went well and not well in my first 6 months working as a Developer. </p>\n<p>If someone would ask, ‚ÄúSo is this what you expected?‚Äù, I‚Äôd say‚Ä¶ HECK YEAH. I love what I do day to day as a Software Developer - building and shipping software product. Although WFH life was not what I expected, it turned out more positive than negative and it will be more important for me to make it better from now.</p>\n<p>This review comes with a couple of reflections and areas of improvement where I‚Äôd like to see myself get better at. I listed down the types of articles to be posted on my blog in coming months:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Singapore Dev Community meet up review</li>\n<li>How to improve as a Front End Software Developer</li>\n<li>How I built XXX as a side project using YYY</li>\n<li>10 new tech skills I‚Äôve learned</li>\n<li>On maintaining good habits</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hopefully I manage to write those articles while staying safe and well from Covid-19. Ending with a quote I love from the meditation app ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù on mind control in this tough times of worldwide pandemic.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 736px;\">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"drawing\" title=\"drawing\" src=\"/static/ae700ad7595df4083e854fa9d3fd7d38/97cfc/calm-quotation.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/ae700ad7595df4083e854fa9d3fd7d38/f93b5/calm-quotation.jpg 300w,\n/static/ae700ad7595df4083e854fa9d3fd7d38/b4294/calm-quotation.jpg 600w,\n/static/ae700ad7595df4083e854fa9d3fd7d38/97cfc/calm-quotation.jpg 736w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"First 6 Months as a Software Developer","date":"September 23, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/essay/6-months-review/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/essay/how-i-became-a-developer-in-6-months/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I Became A Developer in 6 Months ‚úåÔ∏è","category":"essay","draft":false}},"next":null}}}
